# ArnoldC Debug Challenge

### **Welcome to the ArnoldC debug challenge**

ArnoldC is a programing language based on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s one-liners.

Your task for this challenge is to complete the missing arguments in the code file (arnoldDebug.arnoldc), as you can see there are some missing letters in the arguments, your job is to look through the documentation and find the missing letters to complete the code. 

The program prints the even numbers greater than 0 and less than 20.

When you get the expected output, take a screenshot and send it to your team’s chat to get the link for the next challenge.


Before you start, make sure you have java installed.

**Good luck!**
